# Drawing Robot
 dRobTek Group 8 - Semester project 1
 
As a part the robotics technology engineering bachelor education, the first semestes' project is about creating a Drawing Robot. The general idea is to upload an image to a Java program, that then processes and sends commands to a PLC, through a communication socket - Allowing a PLC based drawing robot to draw any given picture, on paper with a pencil.

The only thing given, is the robot is assembled and some Java classes for image- and color manipulation are given. - The rest is up to each group to solve.
